## Technical Experience

### Projects (small engagements/stuff I wanted to do):

  - Python
  - ngrok
  - Twilio

  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - React
  - Next
  - Web hosting (DNS, Vercel)

### Programming Languages

**Java:** This was the first language I learned, however that was over 15 years ago and I've certainly forgotten most of what I learned.

**HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Dabbled with this classic web-development trio in college and to build the occasional site. I didn't find my way back to web development until about two years ago when I started working with JS/TS and Angular/React. For the past year or so I have worked with TS extensively.

**Python:** I learned Python for basic scripting, then transitioned into a role training network engineers and system architects from companies around the world how to manage their on-site and cloud infrastructure with Python. The companies include SAP, NASA, Verizon, Comcast, T-Mobile, UPS, Century Link, and many more.

**R:** I did not know R, then I was brought onto a project for a big government agency so I learned R. I did not enjoy working with it. I completed the project and everyone was happy. I do not want to work with R again.

Basic knowledge of **AWS**, **Docker**, **Linux**, **Regex**, **Solidity/Web3**, **SQL**
